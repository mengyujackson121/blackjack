# Blackjack
This is a personal project to demonstrate knowledge of (and to practice) version control and issue tracking best practices.
Currently this is single player blackjack against a dealer, and nothing is saved between runs of the program. 


## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/mengyujackson121/blackjack.git
